# Java Console Calculator

This is a simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like:
- Addition
- Subtraction

## What I Did

- Used `Scanner` for user input.
- Created separate methods for each operation.
- Added a loop so the user can perform multiple calculations.
- Added proper error handling for divide-by-zero.
- Clean and easy-to-read code structure.

## How to Run

```bash
